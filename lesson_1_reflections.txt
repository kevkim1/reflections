How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It helped see it because I didn't have to scroll through thousands of lines of code to see the diff/
erences, it just highlighted the differences for me.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer i/
n the long term?

It would make me more efficient because I would be able to learn from my past mistakes by seeing th/
em right there in front of me and being able to compare them.
